									<h1>Mentorship program</h1>
									<span>The objective of the NIME mentorship program is to increase the inclusiveness of our community by helping NIME newcomers, especially underrepresented groups and non-native speakers, to be onboarded in the NIME discourse. A mentor is expected to help a newcomer (mentee) positioning her/his work within the NIME discourse and the mentorship would result in a co-authored NIME submission.</span>
									<h2>Who can be a mentee?</h2>
									There are two main categories of mentees:
									<ul>
										<li>Master students or early-stage PhD Students without a supervisor who is part of the NIME/music technology debate.</li>
										<li>Anyone who has not published at NIME before and is without a supervisor who is part of the NIME/music technology debate.</li>
									</ul>
									Being the first edition of the program, we understand that some people are not included in these categories. Therefore, if you feel you need a mentor and do not fit into these categories please send us an email, we are happy to discuss your application. People from underrepresented groups will have priority.
									<h4>How to apply for a mentor</h4>
									<span>To apply for the mentorship program, it is required to submit 1) a short paragraph (abstract) with a research topic/idea (up to 300 words) and 2) a motivation letter (up to 300 words). In the motivation letter, the applicant should ask what type of mentor they want (language, gender, or any other type of preference) and why they would like to have a mentor. </span>
									Apply <a href="https://vault.oddworlds.org/apps/forms/9jQNeaet4FnJD49c">here</a>
									<h2>Who can be a mentor?</h2>
									<span>Everyone with past experience at NIME can volunteer to be a mentor. Everyone who applies to be a mentor has to guarantee at least two hours of supervision time every two weeks from October to January. Each mentor needs to familiarize herself with all the <a href="https://www.nime.org/statements/">NIME codes and statements</a>.</span>
									<h4>Duties of the mentor</h4>
									<span>The mentor and the mentee will develop the idea/topic proposed by the mentee in the application together. The mentor is expected to suggest relevant literature, and help the mentee to position her/his idea/topic within the current music technology debate. This type of support should go beyond the direct objective of writing the paper but help the mentee for future research. Each mentor must dedicate at least two hours every two weeks to work with/supervise the mentee (e.g., a two-hour meeting every two weeks, or a one-hour meeting every week).</span>
									<h4>How to apply to become a mentor</h4>
									<span>Each mentor candidate needs to submit a fill the form with the information about why she/he is capable of being a mentor and where she/he fits, in terms of expertise and in terms of whom she/he would like to mentor as well as a google scholar link or CV.</span>
									Apply <a href="https://vault.oddworlds.org/apps/forms/Tpk2sPG32iBoMH4T">here</a>.

										<li>3rd October - deadline for the open call to request a mentor and to volunteer to be a mentor</li>
